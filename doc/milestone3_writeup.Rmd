### Reflections on Feedback Session  

Our reviewers were able to navigate our app fairly well, but there were a few points of confusion. Most notably, both pairs of reviewers commented on the use of the sliders to enter dates. While they found the use of the slider to select a range of years for the line plot intuitive, our reviewers found the use of a slider to select a single year for the bar plot confusing. They felt the second slider made it seem like they were selecting another range of years instead of a single year. There were also some comments regarding the colour schemes. In particular, one pair of reviewers commented that the same colours were used in the line plot and the bar plot, but the colours represented different things in each plot. We found these comments to be valid and very helpful. We have changed the slider for the bar to chart to a drop down menu, which should make it much clearer that only one year is to be selected. We have also used different colour schemes for the line chart and the bar chart so that the colours do not overlap. 

Some other comments were less helpful. One group commented that it was hard to view cities one at a time using our app. Since the purpose of our app was to show differences across multiple cities, we did not feel that this was a serious problem. The other group commented that it was hard to distinguish the colours on the bar chart when "Homicide" or "Rape" was selected since the bars for those categories were relatively short. Here, we disagreed with our reviewers; we found the delineation of the categories to be clear. Moreover, we felt that the plot highlighted the insight that rape and homicide generally make up a small proportion of total violent crime.  

### Project Update
Overall, the ojective for our app has not changed. We continue to work towards building an app that illustrates the differences in violent crime patterns accross cities. We have, however, made some changes to the design and to the user interface in addition to the changes we made addressing reviewer comments. Firstly, we noticed that when too many cities were added, the line plot became cluttered and hard to read. To address this, we decided to limit the number of cities users can select to six. Secondly, the labels on the bar plot sometimes sometimes overlapped and became illegible. Limiting the number of cities did help address this problem as well, but when cities with long names were selected, the labels still overlapped. We decided to rotate the bar chart so that the bars run horizontally, and the city names are each be on a separate line.
